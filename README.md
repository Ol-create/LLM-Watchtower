# LLM-Watchtower
LLM Security Guardian is an end-to-end LLM observability, security, and anomaly-detection platform built using Google Cloud Vertex AI/Gemini + Datadog. It continuously monitors an LLM application for jailbreak attempts, prompt injection, malicious user behavior, drift, model performance degradation, and runtime anomalies—in real time.
